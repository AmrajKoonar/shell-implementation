# Shell Implementation
Built a Unix shell in C with process execution, internal commands, history recall, and SIGINT handling.

- Developed a Unix shell in C with support for **process execution, internal commands, and history recall**.
- Implemented **signal handling (SIGINT)** for interrupt handling and process control.
- Designed an **interactive shell environment** that supports **custom commands, piping, and redirection**.
- Followed **SFU academic policies**, ensuring that the repository will be updated **after the Spring 2025 semester**.

**ðŸš¨ Note: Code will be added to this Repository after the Spring 2025 Semester ends due to SFU Policies. Thanks for your understanding. ðŸš¨**
